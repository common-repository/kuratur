== Description ==
Kuratur is the painless way to always have fresh relevant content on your blog for free.

If you need to rise above mindless random tickertape presentation and do something meaningful and powerful with curated content, Kuratur is for you. Kuratur makes you look good on your own terms. Kuratur lets you tell the story you need to tell with automated curated content. It's content automation without losing your personal touch.

In just a few minutes, you can curate a page for your blog made up of content pulled from your choice of social media sources. Use any public Twitter accounts or lists, Facebook pages, and RSS feeds in any combination. Set up your Kuratur page once, after that Kuratur keeps your page updated with fresh content from your chosen sources while pulling in the image, headline and summary text from each post to give you a visually engaging page for your visitors. 

Adding one or more Kuratur pages to your blog is great for SEO (search engine optimization). You can add static section titles and text blocks to target your key search terms. This helps build your authority on your topic with the search engines to drive more traffic to your blog. 

The best part is that it's super fast and easy. Most people set up their Kuratur page in less than 15 minutes. After that, it runs itself. It's like getting a full-time content curator and marketer for your blog.
